Sublime Stata 13 2.1.0
----------------------

New feature:
	* Comments that start with a # are now treated as a symbol. This means that 
	  you can make a comment like...

	  *# This is a header

	  or

	  * # This is also a header

	  ... and it will be listed in the Goto Symbol menu (âŒ˜+R or ctrl+R).

	  Thanks to @tedsvo for this feature!
