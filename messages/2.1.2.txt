Sublime Stata 13 2.1.2
----------------------

Enhancements:
    * `bysort` is now highlighted (thanks @Ufos92!)
    * Default and user settings and keybindings are now available from the
      Sublime Text preferences menu. In the past, I foolishly told people to
      edit Default (XXX).sublime-keymap to change the shortcut for the Stata
      13+ or Stata < 13 commands, but every time this package updated, those
      modifications were overwritten. Now it's easier to get to "User/Default
      (XXX).sublime-keymap".
